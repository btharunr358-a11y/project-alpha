Air Quality Forecasting using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting air quality levels using machine learning models. By analyzing environmental data such as pollutant concentrations and weather conditions, the model forecasts Air Quality Index (AQI), which helps in monitoring pollution trends and assisting policy makers in taking preventive measures.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning of air quality datasets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Implementation of machine learning models for AQI prediction

Model evaluation using performance metrics

Forecasting and comparison of results

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

xgboost (if used in your notebook)

📊 Dataset

The dataset used contains air quality measurements such as:

PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, O3

Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed

Ensure you place the dataset in the dataset/ folder before running the notebook.

📈 Results

The project evaluates different ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Metrics used: MAE, RMSE, R² score.

Visual comparisons between actual vs predicted AQI values are included.

🧩 Future Improvements

Integrating Deep Learning models (LSTM, GRU) for time-series forecasting.

Deployment as a web application using Flask/Django.

Real-time data collection from IoT-based air sensors.
